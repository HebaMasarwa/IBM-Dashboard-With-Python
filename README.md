# IBM-Dashboard-With-Python

## Project Overview

This project focuses on replicating a specific IBM dashboard using the Python libraries Matplotlib and Bokeh. The project serves as an exercise in dashboard creation, highlighting the versatility and utility of these libraries in data visualization.

### Objectives

- Replicate the appearance of the original IBM dashboard.
- Demonstrate the capabilities of Matplotlib in generating static graphs.
- Explore the functionalities offered by Bokeh for interactive visualization and layout design.
- Enhance dashboard creation skills using Python.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating static graphs.
- **Bokeh**: For creating interactive elements and layouts.

## Project Files

- **`ibm_data.csv`**: The dataset used in the dashboard's visualizations. It contains all the necessary metrics and dimensions for the IBM data analysis.

- **`ibm_logo.png`**: An image file of the IBM logo used within the dashboard.

- **`main.py`**: The main script for constructing the dashboard.

- **`IBM finalResult`**: The desired output is a PDF file; this is the dashboard we aimed to recreate using Python. (The original dashboard was made using Tableau.)

- **`IBM Dashboard Final`**: Due to the HTML file of the dashboard being too large for GitHub upload, the final output is provided as a PDF file. Nonetheless, the original, interactive HTML dashboard can be accessed by executing the `main.py` file.
